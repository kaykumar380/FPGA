In this project I created a light-weight UART to recofigure the Program Memory of 
a 8052 softcore during runtime.
A terminal program on PC like 'Hterm' can be used to send machine code (bin) to
the Program memory during runtime over UART(RS-232) protocol. The program memory changes
while the core is held on reset. Then the core starts with new program.

Benefit:
For running a new program on the FPGA core, new sythesis is not required-> saves time,
reduces sythesis tool dependency.

All works were done in Xilinx Vivado 2018.3 version...
