2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mod_sel_ins/core_res_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mod_sel_ins/core_res_reg_i_2/O, cell mod_sel_ins/core_res_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mod_sel_ins/rom_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mod_sel_ins/A_r[10]_i_2/O, cell mod_sel_ins/A_r[10]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net recv_ins/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin recv_ins/A_r_s[10]_i_1/O, cell recv_ins/A_r_s[10]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT mod_sel_ins/A_r[10]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 23 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    rom/A_r_reg[0] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[0]_rep {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[0]_rep__0 {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[10] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[1] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[1]_rep {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[1]_rep__0 {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[2] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_reg[2]_rep {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT recv_ins/A_r_s[10]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    rom/A_r_s_reg[0] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[10] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[1] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[2] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[3] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[4] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[5] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[6] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[7] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
