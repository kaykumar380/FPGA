Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1840 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT recv_ins/rom_in[7]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    rom/A_r_s_reg[0] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[10] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[1] {FDRE}
    rom/A_r_s_reg[2] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 rom/opcode_reg has an input control pin rom/opcode_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[13] (net: rom/D[10]) which is driven by a register (core51/ACC_Wr_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
